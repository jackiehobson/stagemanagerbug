# Stage Manager bug in MacOS Ventura 13.2.1

When a system settings help dialog window is minimized with stage manager enabled, the window is minimized and youâ€™re unable to focus on any open application, making the user unable to do their work. I was able to reproduce this multiple times using different help dialogs in the systems settings. As well, I was able to drag windows into another desktop and use them there without issue.

How to reproduce:
1. Open system settings
2. Click any of the help buttons at the bottom of any page
3. Minimize the help popup window

I expected to be able to minimize the help window and then continue using the systems settings app. Instead, I was unable to use any application in that desktop.
